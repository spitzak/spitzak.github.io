<TITLE>Bill Spitzak Artwork</TITLE>

<p>At one time I had some notion that I could be a science
fiction illustrator.  I managed to paint a few things and sell them at
science fiction conventions.  My most productive period was around
1985.

<p><a href=dragonsegg.jpg><img align=left src=dragonseggicon.jpg></a>
DragonsEgg (a neutron star, spinning 5x per second.  The plume of
exhaust is being bent by tidal forces)

<p><a href=liar.jpg><img align=left src=liaricon.jpg></a>
The Liar ship from RingWorld

The Liar after crashing on RingWorld

<p><a href=longshot.jpg><img align=left src=longshoticon.jpg></a>
The Longshot from RingWorld (I did a bunch of RingWorld
paintings).  This won me an award for "Best Amateur Spaceship" at the
Boskone sf convention in Boston 1985

<p><a href=movie.jpg><img align=left src=movieicon.jpg></a>This illustration has
the distinction of making me more money than any other.  It sold for
$125.

<p><a href=osprey.jpg><img align=left src=ospreyicon.jpg></a>
"The Osprey"  A sort of coast-guard cutter for the asteroid belt.
This was a preproduction design I did for a no-budget movie that never
got made.

<p><a href=warpod.jpg><img align=left src=warpodicon.jpg></a>Preproduction
painting for another no-budget movie "Warpod".  The actual movie would
not have had any destroyed buildings.

<p><a href=vatican.jpg><img align=left src=vaticanicon.jpg></a>The
Pope's spaceship.

<p><a href=winged.jpg><img align=left src=wingedicon.jpg></a>CGI of a space
station made for a USC student film called "Winged", directed by Val
Keller.  Over 70 effects shots in this 35mm production.

<p>More to come

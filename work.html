<p>I currently work at <a href=http://www.d2.com>Digital Domain</a>.  This 
is James Cameron's special effects company.  We did Apollo 13, and
True Lies, and Interview with the Vampire, and lots of commercials.

<p>Though now a Digital Artist, in a former life I was a software
engineer at DD.  Every now and then I will write a little bit extra
software, just for old times sake.  I am the original author of
<a href=/Departments/soft/Documentation/Ce/Contents.html>ce (curve editor)</a>
and <a href=/Departments/soft/Documentation/Nuke>Nuke</a> and nfb
(flip book).

<p>I am now working full time on Project 640.

<p>I will be working on Titanic after that.

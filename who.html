<h1>How did I get into movies?</h1>

<br>Movie Production in the Early 1980's</center>

<p>It was not Star Wars. I am too old for that, I was interested in
making films and effects earlier and Star Wars was probably more of a
confirmation that my ideas could work than something that made me want
to do it. I was probably brainwashed into believing that Movies and
Special Effects were a neat thing to work on by the <a
href="http://www.thunderbirdsonline.co.uk">Thunderbirds TV show</a>
when it was rebroadcast here in America when I was about 7, and from
the "disaster" movies of the 70's.

<p>Except for stop-motion super-8 animation, I did not do much about
film until the last year I was at MIT (where I was in course VI-3, as
they call Computer Science).  While there I produced a small comic
strip in The Tech called "Space Epic".  Maybe somebody there remembers
it?  And I started working with a small informal group in Waltham
called Paradox Films that was trying to make a 16mm science fiction
film.  They tried to make several, and I designed and built a number
of spaceship interior sets.  Every time though interest evaporated as
we all realized just how much work making a movie is.

<p>However we also made some sets for commercials, and working on
commercials I found that with paid work, even for a stupid local
commercial, a lot more got done and everybody was much
more enthusiastic. It appears that money, free catered lunch, and most
importantly the fact that somebody else was actually interested in
seeing the project finished, all combined to make a huge difference in
everybody's attitude.

<p>So somehow that made me go to the famous University of Southern
California School of Cinema Television, where I tried to study to be a
Production Designer, and purposely avoided any work with computers,
and maybe start on a design career.

<p>Though I did art direction for several student films, it turns out
that USC is the wrong school to go to for art design (try CalArts or
Pasadena School of Design), and eventually I found myself doing
animation exclusively, and from there doing computer graphics. USC has
since then greatly expanded their animation department to a major
program, but I think I was there with the small group that got them
started on that.

<p>I was hired at Digital Domain as a software engineer. After two
years I decided to work as a Digital Artist, and worked in this
position on the Terminator 2 3D Ride and on <a href=Titanic/index.html>Titanic</a> and several other movies. Almost all my
movie credits are from this period. Perhaps I could have continued as
an artist and tried to get into production design, like I planned to
when I was 7. But it was frustrating that I had no time to fix the
software I was using.

<p>So it seems that Software Engineering has sucked me back and I am
not sure I am going to get out of it. But Open Source software
appeared as a huge deal just about this time, and making it offers the
same opportunity to design something that many can see and appreciate,
just like art design. I just have to make something everybody likes...

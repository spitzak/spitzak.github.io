<p>It turns out that sRGB is a reasonably good way to store
photographic images, because it is approximately <i>perceptually
uniform</i>.  This means it is an efficent encoding of levels of
luminance that matches the human eye's ability to percieve levels of
luminance. This is described in great detail by <a
href=http://www.poynton.com/GammaFAQ.html>Charles
Poynton's Gamma FAQ</a>.

<p>The fact that this is a good encoding is a <i>huge coincidence</i>,
(or it as an indication that our eyes and electronics
designed in the 1920's are both subject to similar laws of physics).

<p>Most images are stored with 8-bit per channel, giving you 256
possible levels of gray. We want to choose 256 levels of gray to store
in these slots to give us the best image. In this example I have used
only 32 slots so the differences are more obvious:

<p align=center><img src=pics/ramp.gif>
<br><img src=pics/linear16.gif>&nbsp;<img src=pics/srgb16.gif>&nbsp;<img
src=pics/log16.gif>

<p>The left column is what you get if you do the "obvious" thing,
which is to multiply the number in the file by a constant to get the
light level, this is called <i>linear</i> coding. As you can see, the
first color above black is quite bright. You would have a hard time
making smooth dark areas in such an image. Also you cannot distinguish
the top colors at all, meaning the bits used to store the difference
between them is totally wasted.

<p>The second column shows 32 levels evenly distributed on the sRGB
curve. Here you can see each step, and each step appears about the
same to your eye and brain. This means it is more uniform
<i>perceptually</i>, even though if you took a light meter and
measured the luminance of each row, you would find the first column is
a straight line while the second is a curve.

<p>Some people, in particular <a
href=http://www.aim-dtp.net/aim/aim_faq.htm>Timo Autiokari</a>, have
argued that sRGB is not <i>perfectly</i> perceptually uniform. Indeed
this is true, the right column shows a <i>logarithmic</i> coding,
where each level is the luminance of the previous multiplied by a
constant. This is obviously more uniform. However there never has been a
claim that sRGB is perfect. sRGB's other claim is <i>it matches how
existing computer displays work</i> and this means that virtually
every digital image in existence today is stored in this format. For
this reason it appears that the minor improvement you get with a more
uniform encoding is not worth it. Logarithmic encoding also has
problems in that there is no way to represent zero light, and it is
not obvious how to increase the bit depth of a log encoding.

<p>(You can read about Timo's arguments with <a
href=http://www.poynton.com/>Charles Poynton</a> about this <a
href=http://www.aim-dtp.net/aim/calibration/poynton/poynton-color-tech.htm>here</a>,
or read <a
href=http://www.poynton.com/notes/Timo/Concerning_Timo.html>Mr
Poynton's responses</a>.) Timo seems to have altered his pages
recently and they now have many examples similar to this page showing
that <i>calculations</i> in linear space are better. However he is
still confused into believing this requires linear storage. As this
paper tries to demonstrate, you can convert from linear to a
non-linear storage quite efficiently.

<p>Lots of people think the solution is to stay linear, but to put
more bits in the file. Years ago 12 and 16 bit storage was very
common. But this is a total waste, all it does is insert the same
number of new slots between each of the existing ones. In the example
above it should be obvious that the linear encoding needs no new
values inserted at the top, but many new values inserted at the
bottom. In fact you would have to go to <i>13</i> bits before the steps near
black are as fine as they are in an 8-bit sRGB file! If you used 13
bits with sRGB you would again be way ahead of the linear encoding for
quality.

<p>A lot of other people think that linear floating point values
should be stored. This does make sense and we do it extensively. But
it turns out that the popular methods of storing floating point
numbers (mantissa + exponent) is in fact somewhat logarithimic. The
steps between each possible number are much finer near black than near
white.

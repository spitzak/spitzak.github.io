<h1>Why Render in Linear Floating Point?</h1>

<p>Almost all image processing and 3D rendering and shading
algorithims written today <i>assumme the image is in Linear Floating
Point</i>. For example most renderers assumme that a projected light, if
spread across an area twice as large as before, will result in a
image value that is half what it was originally, because in the real
world half as many photons reach each portion of the surface.

<p>Unfortunately almost all software out there today assumme images
are stored in files by multiplying Linear Floating Point by some
constant (usually 255).  In reality these images when displayed on a
screen result in luminances that match the <a
href=srgb.html>sRGB</a> curve. A number half as big as another number
is less than 1/4 as bright, and not 1/2 as bright as the algorithim
expected.

<p>Here is a photograph of a real scene, showing some overlapping
lights.

<p>Here is a simulation using rather simple but physically accurate
light calculations. The floating point output of the shading
calculations were converted to sRGB so that the resulting display has
the same luminance as the shading algorithim thought it was
making. Notice that this did pretty good and without any manual
adjustment of the shaders:

<p>Here is what most renderers do when trying to simulate this
scene. They calculate the light quite accurately in linear floating
point, but then assumme that they can store the image by multiplying
by 255 to get the bytes to go into the file:

<br><img src=pics/lightlinear.jpg>#3

<p>Most users of rendering software today see results like #3 above,
and conclude that lighting is much more complex and non-scientific
than they thought. They then throw in fake lights (like global fill),
or paint objects strange colors, or write elaborate shaders that do
not match the laws of physics, in order to compensate for this wrong
conversion and produce the desired output. This is all tedious and
never results in a perfect image, and could be solved by having
renderers correctly convert to sRGB from linear.

<h1>Problems with rendering in Linear Floating Point</h1>

This may all seem obvious and trivial to fix, but there is an enormous
amount of intertia to overcome, and commercial rendering software is
nowhere near ready to do this correctly yet:

<ul>

<li>There are huge libraries of software written that compensate for
this wrong approach, and the output of these looks wrong when the
conversion is done correctly! Fortunatly you can approximate the
conversion from linear to sRGB by the square root, and the conversion
back by the square, and this is accurate enough to fix these
algorithims. So it is possible to rewrite them without slowing them
down a huge amount. [More recently I have started using x/(1+x) as the
conversion function (and x/(x-1) to convert back to linear), this is
faster and handles High Dynamic Range as well].

<li><i>Some</i> rendering software today has "output shaders" to
correctly convert floating point results to sRGB. Most have some way
to write the floating point numbers to a file so you can write a
program to convert them. But in neither case is this easy or the
default setting.

<li>All rendering software today lacks "input shaders" to do the
inverse correction of texture maps that you read in. The result is
that texture maps are almost useless, even if you pre-correct them you
will get bad image quality becuase the resulting map is stored in
linear space, which I showed before is a poor way to store images.

<li>All 3D modelling packages and all 3D graphics hardware draw
without converting from linear to sRGB, so you cannot get wysiwyg
previews of what your renders will look like. New graphics cards
calculate in (16-bit) floating point and are easily capable of doing
the correct conversion to the 8-bit frame buffer, but none do this by
default yet.

</ul>

<p>Maybe these problems will be addressed soon?

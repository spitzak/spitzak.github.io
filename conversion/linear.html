<i>Linear Floating Point</i> means an image represented as floating point
numbers where the luminance of a pixel is the number multiplied by
a constant. I set the constant so that 1.0 is the brightest color you can
see on a typical monitor and the value you want to convert to the
largest value in a typical clipped image format such as a jpeg file.

<p>When you multiply a linear floating point image value by 2, you
will get a new value that is twice as bright. Or you can say that .5
is half as bright as 1.

<p>The values have to be stored in floating point. Storing fixed-point
(or multiplying by a constant and storing integers) is not an
efficient use of memory for storing images, as described <a
href=whysrgb.html>here</a>.

<p><i>High Dynamic Range:</i> Many people think the purpose of
floating point is to store High Dynamic Range (HDR) images, meaning
images with values outside the 0 to 1 range. It is true that most
methods of efficiently storing a floating point value (such as
exponent + mantissa) also will store values outside the 0 to 1
range. And my algorithims are able to convert to and from HDR if you
use functions other than sRGB. But in fact there are <i>many</i>
advantages to linear even if you do not go out of range.

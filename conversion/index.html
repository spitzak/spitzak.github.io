<p>My paper describes a method I have developed at <a
href=www.d2.com>Digital Domain</a> to accurately and quickly convert
between "linear floating point" and the more common "sRGB bytes"
representations of the images. The method is simple and fast. It uses
dithering to avoid posterizing, and can be implemented in hardware.

<p>But it appears that there is still a need to explain exactly
what these terms mean, and why this conversion is desirable. Click on each
of these chapters to read my attempts to explain this rather simple,
but for some reason very confusing, subject:

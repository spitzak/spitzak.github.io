<h1>Why Y?</h1>

The newest version of the Qt tookit does anti-aliased rendering, but
you can only use this interesting graphics feature if you abandon any
other software development and use the Qt toolkit. This can present an
enormous learning curve, or be totally impractical for existing
software, and locks you into GUI design decisions that many disagree
with.

<p>This is equivalent to requiring you to run MySQL in order to use
the "mkdir" command.

<p>The fact that Qt (or MySQL) is free is no excuse. Both are so large
and complex that for the average programmer the source code provides
no more information than a closed-source toolkit.

<p>If you look below Qt you will find Xlib (and the XRender
extension). These supposely low-level interfaces are obscenely
baroque with thousands of calls that nobody can remember, and are in
fact too low level, requiring all modern systems to provide an
interface that matches hardware designed in the 1980's. The interface
is nowhere near abstract enough, either, which can be easily seen in
that no toolkit attempts to emulate Xlib on another system such as
Windows, instead the toolkit code itself is rewritten for that system.

<p>Y is an attempt to solve this, by making a low-level library
that is easy to program and powerful enough that Qt can become a true
portable toolkit, rather than a huge programming system.

<p>I want to try very hard to make Y <i>do everything it should</i>,
and perhaps more importantly: <i>not do anything it shouldn't</i>.

<p>The number one criteria for the Y interface is that it be easy to
program for. The number two criteria is that it be easy to program
for. This is also the number three, four, etc criteria. All other
considerations <i>including efficiency</i> are secondary to this. But
in my experience simple interfaces actually are far more efficient in
the long run, because they don't lock the implementation the way
complex ones do. I think the simple Unix file interface (open, close,
seek, read, write) is a good example, it handles phenominally fast
throughput and disks and networks of a size that was unimagined when
it was designed, and only tiny additions (like copyfile) are
needed. Compare this with the baroque Unix tty interface, which is
useless nowadays except in simplified raw mode.

<h1>How Y?</h1>

The Y library will primarily be seen as a replacement for Xlib.

<p>The initial version runs atop Xlib and Xft and lpr. Later versions
of Y will completely replace Xlib and Xft. After that portions of Y
can be migrated to the X server. An "emulate Xlib atop Y" library will
be written at that time so that new servers that only serve Y clients
will be possible.

<p>A version of Y also works on MicroSoft Windows, to allow programs
using Y to be ported easily between Unix and Windows platforms. This
version uses Win32 GDI much like Xlib is used. There is no plan to
make Windows Y use any lower-level interface. It may be desirable to
make Y libraries for other platforms such as Macintosh.

<p>Y is a C library, to allow easy linking to many languages. Also at
the level of Y "objects" serve no useful purpose and actually make
things harder for the user.

<p>Y provides three basic services: graphics, events, and shell.

<h2>Graphics</h2>

All graphics calls rely on a "current graphics state" which is
implicitly provided to all Y calls, much like OpenGL has such a
state. This does not prevent multithreading, like OpenGL each thread
will have it's own graphics state (not implemented yet, currently Y is
single threaded).

<p>The graphics state will contain the device, window, transformation,
clipping, current color, current font, and other state. There are
calls to duplicate a graphics state, to set the current one, and to
destroy one.

<p>Graphics calls greatly resemble PostScript's base set of
functions. Paths are constructed and then filled/stroked.  The set of
graphics calls will be made as small as possible.  Y graphics are
designed to by non-synchronous: few functions (except obvious library
local functions) have return values. This allows very efficient
buffered pipelines to a server running in a different process or on a
different machine.

<p>The creation, mapping, moving, and destruction of windows are
considered graphics calls.

<p>The library will have redirection tables built in, to easily allow
the graphics calls to be sent to different implementations. The
current version can direct calls to an Xlib implementation, an
Xrender/Xft implementation, to write PostScript to a file descriptor,
and to an OpenGL implementation.

<p>The only form of text accepted is UTF-8, Y will handle encoding
errors such that the vast majority of ISO-8859-1 and Windows encoded
text will display correctly.

<h2>events</h2>

Y will provide an interface to efficiently callback functions when
file descriptors become ready or when the user does things to any
graphics device that they have a graphics context to. A single call,
ywait(time), will do the callbacks and allow a program to accurately
wait a period of time. This will be modeled on the newest versions of
fltk's event handling.

<p>On Unix this could be a totally seperate library. It is part of Y
to allow Y to be portable to Windows and perhaps other systems where
the GUI events do not trigger a file descriptor.

<p>Like X, damage is reported as rectangles. A program may accumulate
these and send the region back as a clip region, like current X
programs. Or a program may set the clip directly to the the current
damage, perhaps getting a larger or more complex area, but unable to
know what it is and thus forced to draw the entire window.

<p>Typing on the keyboard is translated to UTF-8. Y may support
complex character composing services, each keystroke will be reported
as a set of bytes to delete and replace so that preview of
partially-composed letters is trivial for the application.

<p>All possible knobs (like pressure and angle on a stylus) on a
machine will produce events without any setup by the user program. It
is much easier to ignore the events that to arrange them initially.

<p>Drag and drop is supported in a very simple and clean way. All
windows are potential drop targets. The only form of data is URL.

<h2>shell</h2>

Several functions that any program needs to cooperate with other
programs. Currently these are provided by code buried in KDE and
Gnome, inextricably linked with other code that is totally unnecessary
for a program.

<p>A program that may be exec'd called "start" which takes a URL and
does the proper action when a user double-clicks a URL. A switch to
"start" will make it instead print to stdout a list of possible
actions so an interface can provide a menu. The initial version will
use KDE's kdelnk files but I think a nicer design can be made.

<p>A well defined location (~/.start?) will provide a hierarchy of
URL's that an interface can display as a list of useful things the
user may want to select and send to "start".

<p>A list of all "tasks" for each graphics device. Each task is
created by and belongs to one process. For each entry a name, host,
pid, and "start" URL are provided, and a (possibly zero-length) list
of windows belonging to that task, and a parent task. A program may
create as many tasks as it wants and change the window list for
them. Tasks will receive events when the user runs the "start" program
and should respond by opening the provided URL and making a new task.

<p>A list of all "windows" for each graphics device. Each has a name
and a (possibly null) task.

<p>An interface to cause a logout. An interface to logout and login as
another user (requires program to have the new user's privledges). An
interface to cause the calling program to replace the window manager.
